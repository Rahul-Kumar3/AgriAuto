                <p class="lead">Oats is an important Cereal crop as well as fodder crop. Cultivation of Oat is similar as wheat crop. It is mainly grown in Temperate and Subtropical climates. It can also thrive well in high-altitude tropics. They are very popular due to their health benefits. Oat meal is very famous food. Oats is rich in proteins and fiber. They also help in weight loss, controlling blood pressure and for building strong immune system.<br><b>Sowing Time : </b>Second week of October to last week of October is optimum time for sowing seeds.<br><b>Soil : </b>It can be cultivated on all kinds of soil. Well drained loamy soil rich in organic matter is suitable for cultivation. pH range of 5 - 6.6 is optimum for oats.<br><b>Fertilizer : </b>FYM should be added at the time of land preparation. Apply 30 kg of Nitrogen in form of (Urea 66 kg) and 8 kg of Phosphorus (in form of SSP@50 kg) per acre. Apply half dose of nitrogen and full dose of Phosphorus at the time of sowing. Apply remaining amount of Nitrogen, 30-40 days after sowing.</p>

In India it is planted in rabi season. It possesses excellent drought resistance capacity.<br><b>Sowing Time : </b>The crop is sown in the month of mid-October - November.<br><b>Soil : </b>Barley plants are cultivated on significant number of soil such as sodic, light & saline soil. Although, it gives good result in moderately heavy loam to sandy soils having neutral to saline response as well as moderate fertility. Acidic soils are not suitable for barley cultivation.<br><b>Fertilizer : </b>Apply fertilizer dose of N:P:K@25:12:6 kg/acre in term of Urea@55 kg/acre, SSP@75 kg/acre and MOP@10 kg/acre. Apply full dose of phosphorus and potash at time of sowing as a basal application whereas give nitrogen dose before giving pre-sowing irrigation.</p>

              <p class="lead">Maize is second rated grain used collectively in form of foodstuff or fodder. Globally, maize is known as queen of cereals because it has highest genetic yield potential among the cereals. Grains provides food items which are consumed in the form of starch, corn flakes also glucose. It is also used as animal feed in poultry. Maize can be cultivated in any soil as they require less fertile soil and various chemicals. Moreover, it fetch less ripening span, 3 months, in comparison to paddy, which takes 145 days.<br>By growing maize, farmers can easily shield the deteriorating grade of soil , preserve 90% of water and 70% of potency as compared with paddy and can make more profit than wheat and paddy,‚Äù reported by vice chancellor, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. It serves as basic raw material to thousands of industrial products like oil, starch, alcoholic beverages etc. Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, J & K and Punjab are major maize growing states. AP and Karnataka is major producer of maize in south.<br><b>Sowing Time : </b>In kharif season, crop is sown in month of May end to June corresponding with the onset of monsoon. Spring crops are sown during late February to end of march<br><b>Soil : </b>Fertile well-drained alluvial or simply red loams free of coarse elements and full off nitrogen are ideal soils for maize cultivation. Maize can be grown on wide range of soils including loamy sand to clay loam. Heavy clay soil is not suitable for cultivation. Soil test is necessary to know deficiency of any nutrient in the soil.<br><b>Fertilizer : </b>(Apply fertilizer based on soil test result). Apply Super phosphate@75-150 kg, 75-110 kg of Urea and 15-20 kg of Potash (apply only if soil show its deficiency) per acre maize crop. Apply whole amount of SSP and MOP and one third of Urea at time of sowing. Apply remaining dose of nitrogen at knee height stage and pre tasseling stage.

Before fertilizer application, carried out soil test and apply fertilizer on the basis of soil test result. Apply P and K dose if soil test show deficiency of it. If DAP is to be used, apply Urea@100 kg/acre, DAP@27 kg/acre and MOP@20 kg/acre. Apply 1/3rd dose of Nitrogen and whole dose of P and K before last puddling.</p>

Next to rice, wheat is the most important food-grain of India and is the staple food of millions of Indians, particularly in the northern and north-western parts of the country.<br><b>Sowing Time : </b>Wheat must be sown at the optimum time. Delayed sowing causes a gradual decline in the yield of wheat. The time of sowing is 25 October ‚Äì November.<br><b>Soil : </b>Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation.
