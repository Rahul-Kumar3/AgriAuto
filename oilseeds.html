                <p class="lead">Groundnut is the third most important oilseed of world. In India, it is available throughout the year. It is important source of protein grown mostly under rain-fed conditions. In India, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are major groundnut growing states.<br><b>Soil : </b>Groundnut is raised in a sandy loam as well as well drained sandy clay loam soil. Deep well- drained soil with pH of 6.5 -7 as well as having great fertility are perfect for groundnut cultivation.<br><b>Sowing Time : </b>Sow the rainfed crop with the advent of monsoon in the last week of June or in the Ist week of July. Complete sowing as early as possible as delay sowing results in reduction in yield. Where irrigation facility is available sow kharif groundnut from April end to May end.<br><b>Fertilizer : </b>Apply fertilizer dose depending upon Soil testing. Due to this exact amount of fertilizer needed for soil is given and thus unnecessary loss of fertilizer is avoided. Apply Urea@13kg/acre, SSP@50kg/acre and depending upon soil testing if soil show deficiencies of potash then apply 10kg/acre of MoP. Also apply Gypsum@50kg/acre. Broadcast gypsum and drill all fertilizers at time of sowing. Application of gypsum encourages pod formation and better filling up of the pods.</p>

              <p class="lead">India is fourth largest contributor of oilseeds and Rapeseed and mustard contributes about 28.6% in total oilseeds production. After soybean and palm oil, it is third important oilseed in world. Mustard seeds and its oil is used for culinary purpose. Young leaves are used for vegetable purpose. Its oil cake is used for feeding cattle.<br><b>Soil : </b>Light to heavy soil is good for mustard and rapeseed cultivation. Raya can be grown in all type of soil whereas loam to heavy soils are suitable for toria crop. Sandy and loamy sand soils are suitable for Taramira crops.<br><b>Sowing Time : </b>Optimum time for sowing Mustard crop is from September to October month.<br><b>Fertilizer : </b>While preparing field, apply 70 to 120 qtl farm yard manure or well decomposed cow dung in soil. For accurate fertilizer dose, soil testing is necessary. Under irrigated condition for toria crop, apply N:P in ratio of 25:8kg/acre in form of Urea@55kg/acre and Super phosphate@50kg/acre. Apply K dose only when soil show deficiency of it. For raya and gobhi sarson, apply N:P:K in ratio of 40:12:6 kg/acre in form of Urea@90kg, SSP@75kg and MOP@10kg per acre. For rainfed raya crop apply Urea@33kg/acre and Super Phosphate@50kg/acre.</p>

                <p class="lead">Linseed (Linum usitatissimum). In India, it can be cultivated largely for seed meant for eliminating oil. The oil amount of the seed differs from 33-47%. Linseed lubricate is a superb drying lubricant used for processing paints as well as varnishes, oil cloth, water-resistant fabric and even linoleum also like an edible lubricant in certain zones . Linseed-cake is certainly a fine manure as well as livestock feed. Linseed can be used for making papers and also plastics.<br><b>Soil : </b>Does best on deep clayey black soils, clay loams. It grows well in areas where there is high rainfall. Soil pH (5.0-7.0).<br><b>Sowing Time : </b>The time of sowing varies from first fortnight of October to mid-November in different states.<br><b>Fertilizers</b>25 kg of N (55 kg of urea) as well as 16 kg P2O5 (100 kg superphosphate) per acre at sowing. Under irrigated conditions, half dose of N with full amount of P should be applied as basal dose at time of sowing. The remaining N is applied with the first irrigation 35 days after sowing.</p>

It called as sunflower as it follow the sun, always turning toward its direct rays. It is important oilseed crop of country. Sunflower oil is most popular because of its light color, bland flavour, high smoke point and high level of linoleic acid which is good for heart patient. Sunflower seed contains about 48– 53 percent edible oil.<br><b>Soil : </b>t can be grown on wide range of soil from sandy loam to black soils. It gives best result when grown under fertile, well-drained soil. It can tolerate slight alkaline soil. Avoid sowing in acidic also waterlogging soil. Ideal pH is around 6.5-8.<br><b>Sowing Time : </b>To obtain good yield, complete sowing of sunflower by January end.<br><b>Fertilizers</b>Apply 4-5 ton of well decomposed cow dung per acre in soil two to three weeks before sowing. Overall apply N:P@ 24:12 kg/acre in form of Urea@50kg, SSP@75kg in soil. For accurate dose of fertilizer do soil testing and apply doses on basis of it. Apply half dose of nitrogen and full dose of P at time of sowing. Apply rest of nitrogen 30days after sowing. In case of irrigated crop, apply remaining half dose of Nitrogen in two equal splits, first 30days after sowing while remaining after 15 days.</p>
