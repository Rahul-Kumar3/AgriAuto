Napier-bajra is hybridization between bajra and elephant grass. This hybrid increases number of tillers thus yield, quality of forage also minimize risk of becoming weed in case of napier. After plantation, it give yield continuously upto 2-3 years<br><b>Sowing Time : </b>Under irrigated conditions, optimum time for planting is from last week of February to May. For rainfed areas, sowing can be done from June to August.<br><b>Soil : </b>It can cultivate on various soil but gives best result when grown on heavy soils having high nutrient fertility. It is tolerant to mild salinity. Avoid water logged soils for cultivation of napier bajra hybrid.<br><b>Fertilizer : </b>At time of field preparation add well decomposed cow dung@20ton/acre.15 days after sowing, add Nitrogen@30kg/acre in form of Urea@70kg/acre. After each cutting, repeat this nitrogen dose. Apply Phosphorus@40kg/acre in form of SSP@240kg/acre in two equal splits, first dose in spring and second dose in monsoon.
